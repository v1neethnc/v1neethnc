### Hi, I am Vineeth. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science graduate student from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with my specialization in the field of machine learning and data analytics.

- I'm currently working with a team on creating an LLM based application that performs summarization on a query over a database of local documents. 
- In my own time, I'm working on a website for managing quiz questions that I write.
- Currently, I'm spending a lot of my time learning Flask and web development.
- If you have an interesting machine learning or data analytics project, write to me at my email!
